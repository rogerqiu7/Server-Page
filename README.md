# 🗂️ Server Page

## Description

This is a simple server page is running on a Node.js server being accessed in localhost:3000. It is built using HTML, CSS and JS. Each URL requests a different page and the server routes the request to the correct document. Inspiration and guide for this project is from The Odin Project course. You can access this project on my website or at the link in the "About" section of this page.
